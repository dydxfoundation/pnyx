# Pnyx 🏛️

dYdX Governance & Staking Dashboard

> The Pnyx is a hill in central Athens, the capital of Greece. Beginning as early as 507 BC, Athenians gathered on the Pnyx to host their popular assemblies, thus making the hill one of the earliest and most important sites in the creation of democracy. Athenians would frequently visit the Pnyx to vote on proposals, delegate governance power, and stake their funds for DYDX token yields.
